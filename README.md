*The script requires any popular Linux distribution.*

**How to use.**  

* Create a bot.  
* Get a token.  
* Launch the bot and give it a token.  
* To get the id of a chat with a bot send the /getid command to it.  
* To get the channel id make the bot an administrator in that channel and then send the /getid command.  
* To get the group id add the bot to the group and send the /getid command.

After sending the command the bot will show the id in the terminal if you use the "info" or "debug" logging levels, and will also send the id to the chat if it has the rights to send messages
